⭐ Internal Working of HashMap
Ans---
HashMap internally uses an **array of buckets** to store data.
Whenever we insert data into a HashMap using the `put()` method, HashMap first generates a **hashcode** by calling the `hashCode()` method on the key object.
After generating the hashcode, HashMap calculates the **index of the array** using a hashing formula. This index determines the bucket where the data will be stored.
Each bucket in the array stores a **linked list of nodes**. Each node contains a **hashcode, key-value pair, and a reference to the next node**, which helps in handling collisions.
